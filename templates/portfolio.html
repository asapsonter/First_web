                    <p>Hey everyone. I wanted to give you an update on my videos. I will be releasing videos on threading and
                        multiprocessing within the next week. Thanks so much for your patience. I currently have a temporary
                        recording studio setup at my Airbnb that will allow me to record and edit the threading/multiprocessing
                        videos. I am going to be moving into my new house in 10 days and once I have my recording studio setup then
                        you can expect much faster video releases. I really appreciate how patient everyone has been while I go
                        through this move, especially those of you who are contributing monthly through YouTube </p>
                </p>
